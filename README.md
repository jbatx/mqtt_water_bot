Using a water flow hal sensor, measure water consumption, publish is to AWS IoT Core and also turn on/off an AC relay.  

The AC relay could be used for anything.  I use it to turn on a UV sterilizer when the water starts flowing.  This prevents energy wasted in the form of heat by leaving the uv light on all the time.
